# Credit_Risk_Analyis

## Overview of Analysis
  Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem due to good loans outnumbering risky loans.  In order to train and evaluate the models with unbalanced classes, six different machine learning methods were used:
  - ROS
  - SMOTE
  - Undersampling
  - SMOTEENN
  - Balanced Random Forest Classifier
  - Easy Ensemble Classifer
